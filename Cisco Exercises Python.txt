#Exercise 1:
# input a float value for variable a here
a = 1.2
# input a float value for variable b here
b = 5.0
# output the result of addition here
print(a+b)
# output the result of subtraction here
print(a-b)
# output the result of multiplication here
print(a*b)
# output the result of division here
print(a/b)
print("\nThat's all, folks!")

#Exercise 2:
#Your task is to prepare a simple code able to evaluate the end time of a period of time, given as a number of minutes (it could be arbitrarily large). The #start time is given as a pair of hours (0..23) and minutes (0..59). The result has to be printed to the console.

For example, if an event starts at 12:17 and lasts 59 minutes, it will end at 13:16.
hour = int(input("Starting time (hours): "))
mins = int(input("Starting time (minutes): "))
dura = int(input("Event duration (minutes): "))

# calculate end hour and minute
end_min = (mins + dura) % 60
end_hour = (hour + (mins + dura) // 60) % 24

# print the result
print("End time is:",end_hour, ":", end_min)
